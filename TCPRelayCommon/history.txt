===== Release 0.3 =====

v0.3 beta 3
-----------
- General
  - NEW: localization support for:
    - [en-US] English (United States) <default>
    - [pt-BR] Portuguese (Brazil)
    Send me an email (ivan.rober@gmail.com) if you wish to add your language.
    NOTE: only the GUI version has support for localization for now.
- Console
  - FIXED: closed connections no longer crash the console application.
- GUI
  - NEW: localization support, as above. By default the application will use  
    the default language set in your operating system. You can override this by
    passing the language code as an argument to TCPRelay.exe. The supported
    language codes are listed between brackets above.
  - NEW: [a3] application now has an icon (thanks Fryderyk 'Ziel' Dachowski!)
  - NEW: [b] the last Target URI and Listen Port values are now saved to the
    Windows Registry under the key:
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\StrikerX3\TCPRelay
    Now every time you restart TCPRelay the last used server and listen port
    should be automatically set.
  - NEW: [b2] the Target URI list is now saved to a file in the TCPRelay folder
    (serverlist.txt) and reloaded every time TCPRelay starts.
  - NEW: [b2] pressing Enter while typing a Target URI or starting TCPRelay
    will add the current Target URI to the list if not already present.
  - FIXED: [a2] localization should now work properly on all parts of the GUI.
  - FIXED: [a3] tooltips for speed buttons were incorrectly referring to "as
    slow as possible".
  - FIXED: [b3] serverlist.txt is now saved to the user's AppData folder to
    avoid permission issues. The full path under Windows Vista/7/8 is:
	  C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\TCPRelay

===== Release 0.2 =====

v0.2.2.3 beta
-------------
- Console
  - FIXED: application no longer crashes when a connection is closed.
- GUI
  - FIXED: outbound and inbound speeds were swapped.
  - IMPROVED: closed connections now display the overall average speeds.


v0.2.2.2 beta
-------------
- General
  - FIXED: reduced socket buffer size. This should eliminate dropped frames and
    disconnects caused by a change in version 0.2.1.


v0.2.2.1 beta
-------------
- General
  - FIXED: no longer tries to reverse DNS lookup the target host. Should fix
    issues with not being able to connect to certain servers.


v0.2.2.0 beta
-------------
- GUI
  - FIXED: Target URI field no longer loses selection after being populated by
    the Twitch.tv updater.
  - FIXED: speeds below 1 bps no longer show as ",# bps" or "bps".
  - IMPROVED: connection info no longer shows the local host bandwidth (the old
    Received column). Since TCPRelay cannot receive more data than it can push
    to the servers (due to blocking I/O), that column was completely redundant.
    The numbers displayed in the GUI now represent the actual bandwidth usage
    (the old Published column).
  - IMPROVED: average speed is now an average of the last 2 seconds.
  - IMPROVED: connection info now displays connection duration in HH:MM:SS.
  - Speed history graph:
    - IMPROVED: widened to fit the extra available space.
    - IMPROVED: now displays vertical lines every second. Lighter lines
      represent intervals of 10 seconds.
    - IMPROVED: now displays a wide bar with the current speeds to the right of
      the graph.
    - IMPROVED: slightly reduced resource usage.


v0.2.1.0 beta
-------------
 General
  - FIXED: connection attempts may now timeout after 5 seconds.
  - IMPROVED: connection errors are now handled better.
- GUI
  - FIXED: tab order between components is now fixed.
  - FIXED: speed graph no longer stops working after a while.
  - FIXED: sometimes clearing all closed connections would cause the scrollbar
      graphics to remain on the window.
  - IMPROVED: added tooltips to several components.
  - IMPROVED: target URI now accepts addresses in <host>:<port> format.
  - IMPROVED: error messages are now shown if TCPRelay fails to start.
  - IMPROVED: connection attempts and errors are now shown in the list.
  - IMPROVED: connection list refresh speed can be changed.


v0.2 beta
---------
- Completely rewritten in C#. TCPRelay now requires .NET Framework 4 instead
  of Java. Should help eliminate some of the issues people were having with the
  Java Virtual Machine.
- NEW: created a graphical user interface for easier configuration and real-time
  connection and bandwidth usage statistics.
- FIXED: -ttv now lists the default Twitch.tv server as well.


===== Release 0.1 =====

v0.1.1 beta
-----------
- NEW: You may now list all available Twitch.tv ingestion servers. Simply run:
    TCPRelayC -ttv
  from the command line.
- IMPROVED: When providing a RTMP URL, TCPRelay will now display the custom RTMP
  URL you should use in XSplit. Useful for other services such as own3d.tv.


v0.1 beta was the first public release of TCPRelay.
